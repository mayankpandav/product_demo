Objective of this test:

1. Unleash your creativity
2. Demonstrate clean maintainable code
3. Testing skills if it is something you have done before.

You are tasked with creating a POC to use JSON data returned from an Api endpoint and create an eShop.
The eShop is one 2 page website, one landing and another basket. 
The landing page has a list of products that can be added to the basket.
When a product is added to basket it should update the basket icon.
When clicked on basket, it should take the user to the basket page and show all the items that were added to the basket.

You are allowed to use any of the following technology:
1. VueJs
2. React
3. Vanilla JS

There is not limit to what you can do here but I would recommend the following approach.

1. Write the part the gets the data from the JSON as it would from an API first.
2. Display the data on the landing page in a very rudimentary way.
3. Add the basket functionality.
4. Style up your HTML and clean your code.
5. Write some UI tests if you have experience doing that.

I would not recommend spending more that 2-3 hours to do the exercise, however if it is entirely upto you on how long you spend.
